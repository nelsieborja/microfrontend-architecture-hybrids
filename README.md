# Microfrontend Architecture With [Hybrids](https://hybrids.js.org/)


TODO

- [x] Hybrids as the main library, for a future-proof components
- [x] Redux Toolkit for global state (and maybe for independent components). [Post.js](https://github.com/postaljs/postal.js) as an alternative using pub/sub approach
- [ ] Integration with other libraries (React or probably [one if these](https://buttercms.com/blog/javascript-ui-frameworks-libraries-for-2020))
